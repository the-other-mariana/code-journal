# Regular Polygon Spiral

This is a small script that creates a series of polygons to form an exact and calculated spiral.<br />

The [pdf document](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/code-journal/blob/master/poly-spiral/CJ06_PolygonSpiral.pdf) also in this folder explains further theory and the concepts I used.<br />

## Specifications

Python version: `3.6.2` <br />

## Usage

1. Download this folder and store it in your computer.
2. Go to the folder's directory.
3. Type on Powershell: `python geom-figs.py`.

## Output

For a square with 12 iterations, the output I got was the following: <br />

Also, an hexagon of 6 iterations looks like below: <br />
