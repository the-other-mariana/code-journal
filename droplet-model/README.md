# Water Droplet Model

This is a small Wolfram Mathematica notebook that describes in a simple way how to create a water drop figure. You can find the explanation in the [pdf file](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/code-journal/blob/master/droplet-model/CJ01_WaterShader.pdf).<br />

## Specifications

Mathematica version: `11.3` <br />

## Output

I also did a small animation of the model.<br />
