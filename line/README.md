## Line Function implementation

This is a small code that paints a line between two given points in an image, using polar coordinates. Implemented in Python 3.6 <br />

## Usage 

Download `line.py` and store it your computer. <br />
Type `python line.py` in your command prompt. <br />

### Code Example

When you import `line.py` to your project, type: <br />

```
grid(gridGap, img) # paints grid
line([0, 30], [-100, 60], 7, [255, 0, 0], img)
```

And you will get a blue line from point `0, 30` to point `-100, 60` with 7 pixels of thickness: <br />
